# Hospital Management System

Hospital Management System (HMS)is a Health Managememnt System built on @æternity Blockcahin, that helps to record patients data, stores the data on the blockchain, Records data of the medical personnel that attends to the patient and in a recent update that I am still working on, courtesy of Akshwani Haeck, HMS will also have a Common Sicknesses and Medications API feature that works with an Oracle and a Dummy API to provide medications of common sicknesses. Other updates to expect from HMS includes: a Location feature that work with your current location and directs you to Public Health Centres / Hospitals around your location.
